#What is this?
This is a small library to be used by quiz authors for the "bonnie" assignment grader.  The current intention is for this to be included as a git submodule within the starter code provided to students.

Use
<pre>
	<code>
		git submodule add https://github.gatech.edu/sb300/bonnie-libsubmit.git bonnie
	</code>
</pre>

to add this to repo that is shared with the students.  


Can instruct them to checkout the repository with the `--recursive` option or to run
<pre>
        <code>
                git submodule init
                git submodule update
        </code>
</pre>
once they have cloned the repo.
